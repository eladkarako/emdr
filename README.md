Or hover the mouse cursor over the top-left corner and the player will be presented, <br/>
then click the play button. <br/>

<hr/>

You can use the keyboard to play/pause the audio (once allowed to play, or after you've clicked the player once), <br/>
using the key <kbd>1</kbd>. <br/>
You can switch the animation to a different one using the key: <kbd>2</kbd> in your keyboard, there are about ~7. <br/>

Each time you'll reload the page you'll get a different animation, <br/>
this functionality is based on a cookie that saves the number of the last-animation. <br/>

<hr/>

The page can operate without the need of JavaScript, <br/>
and without the need of cookies, but in this case you'll need to press the audio-play button yourself, <br/>
and the animation will be just the first one. <br/>
